Demonstration of the [SparkFun nRF52832 Breakout Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13990). Load the nRF52832_Breakout_Demo.ino file onto the nRF52832 Breakout Board. 

Use the [IntelÂ® XDK](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-xdk) to build the XDK_BLE_Controller for your phone. You will need to change `deviceId` in *app.js* to your nRF52832's BLE MAC address.

As the Arduino code is running on the nRF52832, open the phone app, which should automatically connect to the nRF52832. Press ON to send the "on" signal over BLE and press OFF to send the "off" signal (i.e. write a 1 or 0 to the BLE characteristic).

**IMPORTANT**: Add a transistor as a switch between pin 8 on the nRF52832 and the +in pin on the PowerSwitch Tail.
